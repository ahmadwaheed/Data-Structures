<h2>Splay Trees</h2>

<a name="Summary"></a><h3>Summary</h3>
Splay Trees were invented by Sleator and Tarjan. This data structure
is essentially a binary tree with special update and access rules. It
 has the wonderful property to adapt optimally to a 
sequence of tree operations.
<p>

</p><p>
More precisely, a sequence of <em>m</em> operations
on a tree with initially <em>n</em> nodes takes time 
<em>O (n ln (n) + m ln (n))</em>.

<!--
<a name="Splay"></a><h3>Splay Operation</h3>

<p>
The most important tree operation is <b><tt>splay(x)</tt></b>, which
moves an element <tt>x</tt> to the root of the tree. In case <tt>x</tt> 
is not present in the tree, the last element on the search path for 
<tt>x</tt> is moved instead.

<p>
The run time for a <tt>splay(x)</tt> operation is proportional to the
length of the search path for <tt>x</tt>: While searching for <tt>x</tt> we
traverse the search path top-down. Let <tt>y</tt> be the last node on that 
path. In a second step, we move <tt>y</tt> along that path by applying 
rotations as described <a HREF="#Rotations">later</a>.

<p>
The time complexity of maintaining a splay trees is analyzed using an
<b>Amortized Analysis</b>. Consider a sequence of operations
<em>op_1, op_2, ..., op_m</em>.
Assume that our data structure has a potential. One can think of the potential
as a bank account. Each tree operation <em>op_i</em> has actual costs 
proportional to its running time. We're paying for the costs <tt>c_i</tt> 
of <em>op_i</em> with its <b>amortized costs</b> <tt>a_i</tt>. The 
difference between concrete and amortized costs is charged against the 
potential of the data structure. This means that we're investing in the 
potential if the amortized costs are higher that the actual costs, otherwise 
we're decreasing the potential.</b>

<p>
Thus, we're paying for the sequence <tt>c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m </tt> no more
than the initial potential plus the sum of the amortized costs <tt>a_1 +
a_2 + ... + a_m</tt>.
<p>
The trick of the analysis is to define a potential function and to show that
each splay operation has amortized costs <em>O (ln (n))</em>.
<p>
<h4>Example</h4>
The examples illustrate a splay operation on a leaf node in a complete binary 
tree and a splay operation on tree in form of a linear list. Observe how each 
tree is changing while the splayed element is rotated to the root.

<a name="Operations"></a></p><h3>Operations</h3>
<p>
Splay trees support the following operations. We write <tt>S</tt> for
sets, <tt>x</tt> for elements and <tt>k</tt> for key values.
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>splay(S,k)</tt></td>
<td>returns an access to an element <tt>x</tt> with key <tt>k</tt> 
in the set <tt>S</tt>. In case no such element exists, we return an
access to the next smaller or larger element.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>split(S,k)</tt></td>
<td>returns <tt>(S_1,S_2)</tt>, where for each <tt>x</tt> in <tt>S_1</tt>
holds: <tt>key[x] &lt;= k </tt>, and for each <tt>y</tt> in <tt>S_2</tt> 
holds: <tt>k &lt; key[y] </tt>.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>join(S_1,S_2)</tt></td>
<td> returns the union <tt>S = S_1 + S_2</tt>. Condition:
for each <tt>x</tt> in <tt>S_1</tt> and each <tt>y</tt> in <tt>S_2</tt>:
<tt>x &lt;= y</tt>.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>insert(S,x)</tt></td>
<td>augments <tt>S</tt> by <tt>x</tt>.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>delete(S,x)</tt></td>
<td>removes <tt>x</tt> from <tt>S</tt>.
</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

</p><p>
Each <tt>split, join, delete </tt> and <tt>insert</tt> operation 
can be reduced to <tt>splay</tt> operations and modifications of the 
tree at the root which take only constant time. Thus, the
run time for each operation is essentially the same as for a <tt>splay</tt>
operation.

<a name="Rotations"></a></p><h3>Rotations</h3>
The <tt>splay</tt> operation moves the accessed element <tt>x</tt> to
the root of the tree <tt>T</tt>. This is done using rotations on 
<tt>x</tt> and parent <tt>y</tt> and grandparent <tt>z</tt>.

<p>
There are two kinds of <em>double</em> rotations and one
<em>single</em> rotation. Due to symmetry, we need mirror-image versions of 
each rotation.


</p><p>
<b>Type 1: </b>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; x &lt; y &lt; z </tt>, &nbsp; or
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; z &lt; y &lt; x </tt>  &nbsp; respectively.<br>

<br>
<applet codebase="classes/" code="Main3.class" width="450" height="250">
</applet>

</p><p>
<b>Type 3:</b>
The last case deals with the situation that the splay node <tt>x</tt> is
a child of the root. Thus, we need a <em>single</em> rotation.
</p><p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; x &lt; y </tt>, &nbsp; or 
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; y &lt; x </tt>  &nbsp; respectively.
