<title>AVL tree applet</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
        <font size="2" face="Arial">The
        inset below illustrates the behavior of an AVL-balanced
        tree. You can insert, delete and locate nodes in the tree
        using control buttons. All operations are animated. If an
        action is initiated when another animation is still
        running, the current task is expedited allowing the new
        animated process to start. The data can be entered
        manually or randomly generated. By pressing
        &lt;Insert&gt; button only, you can quickly build a large
        tree. If the &lt;AVL&gt; option is not checked, the
        algorithm will no longer balance the tree after
        insertions and deletions. If this option is enabled for
        an existing structure, the whole tree will be
        rebalanced.</font><p>

        Feel free to play with the
        tree and grab individual nodes with your mouse. The
        applet will point out the previous and next nodes
        depending on the selected traversal method. Changing
        &lt;Shape&gt; will be useful when the tree grows larger.
        You can also &lt;Shake&gt; the tree to keep the bugs out.</font>
